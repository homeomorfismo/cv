# Academic CV

This repo is a fork from [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/)'s **LaTeX academic CV**.It is icensed for others to adapt. The CV content and formatting generally conform to Karen Kelsky's [guidelines](https://theprofessorisin.com/) with tweaks for clearer information presentation and better typography.

<!--- The CV's TeX file is **automatically compiled** to PDF and published whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch, via this [workflow](https://github.com/gboeing/cv/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml). This keeps the publicly distributed PDF up-to-date while avoiding commit history pollution from frequent changes to a binary file. -->
